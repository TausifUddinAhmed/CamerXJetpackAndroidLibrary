# CamerXPractise
 
Jetpack cameraX library has been used here instead of native camera app to  user camera feature in tha app
some key point :
- viewbinding is used to bind xml's view
- image is converted to bitmap to further use in the future
- after captureing, image is stored to external storage so that others app can see  it
